# NetworkScanner / Branch MultiThreading 
A Network Scanner Tool which scans all active hosts in a network(or subnet).

This project is used to scan all available devices on a subnetwork(Local Network).
To get a track of all devices connected to your sub-network.
In the Local networks, many times there are unnecessary devices connected,
  e.g. Old Servers, unused VMs, etc. So this application will help in viewing 
        all devices connected to network consuming bandwidth.
Since, this application scans each possible address on the network,
  its slow at times. Thus multi-Threading is implemented to enhance speed .
