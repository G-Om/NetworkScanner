# NetworkScanner / Branch MultiThreading 
A Network Scanner Tool which scans all active hosts in a network(or subnet).

<li>This project is used to scan all available devices on a subnetwork(Local Network).</li><br>

<li>To get a track of all devices connected to your sub-network. </li><br>

<li>In the Local networks, many times there are unnecessary devices connected,
    e.g. Old Servers, unused VMs, etc. So this application will help in viewing 
        all devices connected to network consuming bandwidth. </li><br>

<li>Since, this application scans each possible address on the network,
  its slow at times. Thus multi-Threading is implemented to enhance speed.</li><br> 
<br> My Current Local network : 192.168.0.1/24 i.e 255.255.255.0
<br> 255 addresses are possible, Thus this application scans all of them.
