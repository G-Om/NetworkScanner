# NetworkScanner / Branch MultiThreading 
A Network Scanner Tool which scans all active hosts in a network(or subnet).

This project is used to scan all available devices on a subnetwork(Local Network).<br>
To get a track of all devices connected to your sub-network. <br>
In the Local networks, many times there are unnecessary devices connected, <br>
  e.g. Old Servers, unused VMs, etc. So this application will help in viewing <br>
        all devices connected to network consuming bandwidth. <br>
Since, this application scans each possible address on the network, <br>
  its slow at times. Thus multi-Threading is implemented to enhance speed. <br>
